# AiModelOptimizerAIUltra

## Description

A hybrid cognitive architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with deep learning, utilizing graph neural networks for knowledge graph embedding and probabilistic programming for uncertainty quantification.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the AiModelOptimizerAIUltra software project:
- "Optimizes neural network architectures using automated hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization",
- "Supports model pruning and knowledge distillation for efficient model deployment on edge devices",
- "Provides explainability and transparency through saliency mapping and feature importance analysis",
- "Integrates with popular deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras",
- "Includes automated data augmentation and preprocessing pipelines for image and text data",
- "Performs realtime model inference and latency optimization for highthroughput applications",
- "Offers distributed training and parallelization using Apache Spark and Hadoop"
- Let me know if you'd like me to adjust or add anything!
